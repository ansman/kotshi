Kotshi ![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/ansman/kotshi.svg?branch=master)
===

An annotations processor that generates [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) adapters from immutable Kotlin data classes.

Moshi's default reflective adapters assume your classes are compiled from Java code which causes problem for Kotlin
data classes.

There is a reflective adapter for Kotlin but that requires the kotlin reflection library which adds a lot of methods and
increase the binary size which in a constrained environment such as Android is something is not preferable.

This is where Kotshi comes in, it generates fast and optimized adapters for your Kotlin data classes, just as if you'd
hand written them yourself. It will automatically regenerate the adapters when you modify your class.

It's made to work with Kotlin data classes with minimal setup, through there are [limitations](#limitations).
Most of the limitations will be addressed when the support for Kotlin annotation processors improves.

Usage
---
First you must annotate your Kotlin data classes with the `@JsonSerializable` annotation:
```kotlin
@JsonSerializable
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    val email: String?,
    val hasVerifiedAccount: Boolean,
    // This property has a different name in the Json than here so @Json must be applied.
    @Json(name = "created_at")
    val signUpDate: Date,
    // This field has a default value which will be used if the field is missing.
    val jobTitle: String? = null
)
```

Then create a class that will be your factory:
```kotlin
@KotshiJsonAdapterFactory
object ApplicationJsonAdapterFactory : JsonAdapter.Factory by KotshiApplicationJsonAdapterFactory
```

Lastly just add the factory to your Moshi instance and you're all set:
```kotlin
val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
    .add(ApplicationJsonAdapterFactory)
    .build()
```

By default adapters aren't requested for primitive types (even boxed primitive
types) since it is worse for performance and most people will not have custom
adapters anyway.
If you need to use custom adapters you can enable it per module be passing the
`useAdaptersForPrimitives` to `@KotshiJsonAdapterFactory` or on a per adapter
by passing the same argument to `@JsonSerializable` (the default is to follow
the module wide setting).

### Annotations
* `@JsonSerializable` is the annotation used to generate `JsonAdapter`'s. Should only be placed on Kotlin data classes.
* `@KotshiJsonAdapterFactory` makes Kotshi generate a JsonAdapter factory. Should be placed on an abstract class that implements `JsonAdapter.Factory`.

### Default values
You can use default values just like you normally would in Kotlin. 

Due to limitations in Kotlin two instances of the object will be created when a class uses default values 
([youtrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-18695)). This also means that composite default values are not
supported (for example a `fullName` property that is `"$firstName $lastName"`). 

### Transient Values

Properties marked with `@Transient` are not serialized. All transient properties must have a default value.

Only properties declared in the constructor needs to be annotated since other properties are ignores.

Limitations
---
* Kotshi only processes files written in Kotlin, types written in Java are not support.
* Only data classes are supported.
  - Only constructor properties will be serialized.
* Due to limitation in KAPT properties with a java keyword as a name cannot be marked as transient.
* Default values that depend on other constructor properties is not supported ([youtrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-18695)).
